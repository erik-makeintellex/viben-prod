# Prime Agent Cloud: MCP-Powered Coordination Framework

This project provides a scalable, modular, and collaborative architecture for AI agent coordination using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It includes bootstrappable Docker environments, agent-cloud templates, strategic authorization mechanisms, and a generalized knowledge structure useful across many industries.

This design allows individual or multiple agents to operate in localized or centralized environments, with shared workflows and service layers powered through MCP-compatible microservices.
