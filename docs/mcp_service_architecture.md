# MCP Service Architecture for Scalable AI Workflows

## Introduction

This document describes a stable, scalable architecture for hosting Multi-Container Process (MCP) services. The goal is to enable workflows that utilize MCP nodes flexibly — either centralized or distributed — while maintaining security, authorization, and efficiency.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. MCP Node Types  
- **Centralized MCP Nodes:** Hosted in cloud or data centers, serve multiple clients/agents.  
- **Distributed MCP Nodes:** Edge or client-hosted nodes, closer to data or specific agent groups.  
- **Hybrid Setup:** Combines centralized and distributed nodes for optimal performance.

### 2. MCP Node Hosting  
- Use container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) to deploy MCP nodes.  
- Nodes run as isolated, containerized microservices with defined APIs for task execution and communication.

### 3. Secure Access and Authorization  
- Employ token-based authorization (OAuth2/JWT) for client and agent access.  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit node capabilities per user or client.  
- Use TLS/mTLS for encrypted communication between nodes and clients.

### 4. Workflow Orchestration  
- Agents request MCP services dynamically based on workload and proximity.  
- Orchestrator manages load balancing and failover across MCP nodes.  
- State synchronization handled via distributed caches or message brokers (e.g., Redis, Kafka).

### 5. Monitoring and Logging  
- Integrate centralized logging (ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana) for all MCP nodes.  
- Health checks and metrics exposed via standardized endpoints.  
- Alerts configured for node failures or performance degradation.

## Deployment Strategy

- Provide a **generic Docker Compose** template for quick local or cloud setup.  
- Support multi-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, MacOS) for local development.  
- Recommend cloud provider Kubernetes manifests for production-grade deployment.

## Benefits

- **Scalability:** Add or remove MCP nodes as needed without disrupting workflows.  
- **Resilience:** Failover capabilities minimize downtime.  
- **Security:** Granular authorization protects sensitive workloads.  
- **Flexibility:** Supports single-node or multi-node orchestration patterns.
